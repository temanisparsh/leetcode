{"link": "https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-subsequence-in-non-increasing-order", "name": "Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order", "difficulty": "Easy", "statement": "<div><p>Given the array <code>nums</code>, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is <strong>strictly greater</strong> than the sum of the non&nbsp;included elements in such subsequence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with <strong>minimum size</strong> and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the <strong>maximum total sum</strong> of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>. Also return the answer sorted in <strong>non-increasing</strong> order.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,3,10,9,8]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [10,9] \n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included, however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements.&nbsp;\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,4,7,6,7]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [7,7,6] \n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing order.  \n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [6]\n<strong>Output:</strong> [6]\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 500</code></li>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 100</code></li>\n</ul></div>", "language": "cpp", "solution": "#include <iostream>\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> minSubsequence(vector<int>& nums) {\n\n        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());\n        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());\n        int sum = 0;\n        int totalsum = 0;\n        vector<int> res;\n\n        for(int i: nums)\n            totalsum += i;\n\n        for (int i: nums) {\n            sum += i;\n            res.push_back(i);\n            if (sum > totalsum / 2) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return res;\n        \n    }\n};"}
